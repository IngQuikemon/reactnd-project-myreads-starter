Welcome to the Bookshelf Application. This tool will allow you to place the books
you have in the right section, as well as to add more to your shelf. Hope you
find the tool useful. Let's get started.

## Installation

To start using the applicatoin, clone the repository to your computer, or download
the zip file and on the folder root where you copied, follow these steps:

* Run `npm install` to download all the libraries needed on the app.
* Once all the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running
`npm start`

Once the application has been compiled, a browser window will pop up and you can
start using the application right away.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
